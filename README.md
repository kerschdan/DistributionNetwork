# Distribution Network

The optimization problem aims to find the minimum costs for sending products through a distribution network. 

Three factories produce one kind of product in variable unit sizes. The products are then shipped to distribution centers. From the distribution centers,
they are sent off to their final destination, the warehouses. Each shipment comes at a cost, which is stated as the price per shipped product. 

The number of fabricated products, shipment costs per lane, number of needed products in the warehouses, and restrictions on how many products can 
pass a lane, are provided in the sketch.png file.
